PyElectroMan is a Python port of 1992 PC game Electro Man (aka Electro Body, a cult game in Poland where it was developed).

The project has been started to improve author's Python skills rather than to eventually become a released game but it's fate will be determined by those who decide to take it further.

The port uses art assets from the original game (licensed under CC BY-SA).

The project intends to recreate the functionality of the original to some extent. The port is based on the original source code (which hasn't been publicly released) but due to its complex nature (to put it mildly) the exact conversion may not be feasible. Also the quality of the original code affects the quality of Python code - at this moment the conversion accuracy takes precedence over quality and style.

This is author's side project - the updates are when the time is permitting him to work on it.

Dependencies: [pygame](http://www.pygame.org) and everything pygame depends on. Probably needs at least Python 2.7+ (obviously not 3+) as well.
